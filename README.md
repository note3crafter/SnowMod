# SnowMod v.1.0.0

This plugin is not a simple change of the Biome but lets it snow like in Vanilia and the snow stays as you are used to! He places the snow on the ground. 

!Warning!

There is currently no function that removes the SnowLayer, which means that when the plugin is removed, they remain It is also snowing in every world on the server where this plugin is installed.
The Biome is changed during installation and this Biome remains when the plugin is removed.
