# SnowMod v.2.0.0

This plugin is not a simple change of the Biome but lets it snow like in Vanilia and the snow stays as you are used to! He places the snow on the ground. 

New Update:
- Use the Command /snowmod to enable or disable the Mod!

!Warning!

The SnowMod is currently active in every world on the server! However, this will be added in the upcoming update.
